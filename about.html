I am a recent graduate from Georgia Institute of Technology. 
Currently working as a Applied Researcher at Ebay on the Search Data Science team. 
I am interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, Graph algorithms and Functional programming languages. 
When I am away from my computer, I will be either at the local Climbing wall or playing Cricket for the Stanford Cricket Club.

This blog is more of a experimental log of my exploration of Machine Learning algorithms, packages, tools and technology. 
All views expressed here are mine.
