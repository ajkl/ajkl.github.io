<p>I was taught Machine Learning @ Georgia Institute of Technology. 
<br>Currently working as a Applied Researcher at eBay on the Search Data Science team. 

<p>I am interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, Graph algorithms and Functional programming languages. 
<br>When I am away from my computer, I will be either at the local Climbing wall or playing Cricket for the Stanford Cricket Club.</p>
