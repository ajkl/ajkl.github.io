<p>I was taught Machine Learning @ Georgia Institute of Technology. 
<br>Currently working as a Applied Researcher at eBay on the Search Data Science team. 

<p>I am interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, Graph algorithms and Functional programming languages. 
<br>When I am away from my computer, I will be either at the local Climbing wall or playing Cricket for the Stanford Cricket Club.</p>

This blog is more of a experimental log of my exploration of Machine Learning algorithms, packages, tools and technology. 
<br>All views expressed here are mine.
