# Char-rnn generated Seinfeld Episode

This post explores character-level multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network as language models. It uses Andrej Karpathy's char-rnn library [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). He has a detailed blog post on it, explaining various experiments with these RNNs. There have been some interesting experiments based on it, from generating cooking recipes, bible rewrite and Obama speeches to rap and music composition. 
I wondered how well will it generate sample scripts of Seinfeld episodes if I train the model on all 180 episode scripts. Results were pretty interesting.

Seed "JERRY"

```
ERRY: Hearing anyone amazing. (They both sit down, but on one.) DOCTOR: I explain the TV Marya Henungician. JERRY: I mean she put some guy down and stor it like that.

Pretty interesting results given the fact that the model works at character level without knowing any english grammar rules!
